# ecosystem-images

All the images required for the ecosystem and built by Konflux. As of today it holds:
- [`opc`](./opc/) from [`openshift-pipelines/opc`](https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/opc)
- [`git-init`](./git-init) from [`tektoncd-catalog/git-clone`](https://github.com/tektoncd-catalog/git-clone)

The source code of each of these images are synced from their respective upstream repositories, and the `Dockerfile` are generated.

All of this is build using the Red Hat [`konflux-ci`][konfluxci] instance, and most of it's configuration is [here](./.konflux).
As [`konflux-ci`][konfluxci] uses [Tekton][tekton] and [`pipelines-as-code`][pac], the "CI" definition is available [here](./.tekton).

## Branch management and *oci images*

The `main` branch tracks upstream `main` branch of each images. 
The oci image generated are pushed to `registry.stage.redhat.io` and tagged with the git commit hash as well as the date.

We maintain release branches for each OpenShift Pipeline version. This means, there is (or will be), a `release-v1.16.x` branch, a `release-v1.17.x` branch, and so on. Those branches usually track release version of the upstream project *but* if there is no release, could track main (or a fork that we maintain) â€” this will be done case by case.
The oci image generated are pushed to `registry.redhat.io` and tagged with the version as well as the git commit hash.

### Existing branches (and support)
